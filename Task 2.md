In this task, you will be required to read the questions carefully and understand that business requirement. Once you have an idea of what is required from the perspective of the CEO and CMO, you will need to come up with the perfect visual which will illustrate what the senior managers are looking for in each scenario. Remember, data can be presented in multiple types of charts, but you are required to select the visual that would best display the information which is being presented.

You will be provided resources on how to select visuals based on the different scenarios, these are available in the resources below. These resources will help you get an idea on which visual to select for the given business scenario and will also guide you on how to choose the right chart or graph for your data. Each question will contain a unique scenario and you will be expected to answer the questions based on that scenario.

Typically, to build or describe any visualization with one or more dimensions, we can use the components as follows.

1. Data: Always start with the data, identify the dimensions you want to visualize.
2. Aesthetics: Confirm the axes based on the data dimensions, positions of various data points in the plot. Also check if any form of encoding is needed including size, shape, color and so on which are useful for plotting multiple data dimensions.
3. Scale: Do we need to scale the potential values, use a specific scale to represent multiple values or a range?
4. Geometric objects: These are popularly known as ‘geoms’. This would cover the way we would depict the data points on the visualization. Should it be points, bars, lines and so on?
5. Statistics: Do we need to show some statistical measures in the visualization like measures of central tendency, spread, confidence intervals?
6. Facets: Do we need to create subplots based on specific data dimensions?
7. Coordinate system: What kind of a coordinate system should the visualization be based on — should it be cartesian or polar?
